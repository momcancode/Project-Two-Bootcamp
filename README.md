## What is this project about?

Victoria is home to a number of threatened species. Some of these are rare to see in the wild but well worth the effort for avid animal lovers, families looking for an adventure, or those who are staycationing at Victoria's national parks, coastal towns, and regional towns.

**[Our web app](https://cool-cats-project-two.herokuapp.com/)** is built up using fauna sightings data from 2015 to 2020 provided by Victorian Biodiversity Atlas (VBA). The VBA fauna observations are a foundation dataset that feeds into many biodiversity tools used in government's everyday decision making for nature conservation - showing where wildlife is now and how this has changed over time. This makes it a core input to the majority of the government's processes and programs that impact native species.

Our interactive map is designed to help you identify what type of threatened species has been seen in a particular area. If you want to learn more about some of the threatened species, please check out our dashboard and data pages.
